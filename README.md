# Conditional Statements Practice ðŸ§ 

## Overview

This repository contains simple Bash script examples demonstrating the use of **conditional statements** such as `if`, `if-else`, and `if-elif-else`.
The goal of this practice is to understand how decision-making works in shell scripting and how different conditions can control the program flow.

## What Iâ€™m Learning

* Basics of `if` conditions in Bash
* Using `if-else` and `if-elif-else` structures
* Handling **exit statuses** to control script behavior
* Managing **missing or invalid user input** gracefully

## Implemented Examples

Each script in this repository includes:

* Checks for missing input parameters
* Proper exit codes for different outcomes (`exit 0`, `exit 1`, etc.)
* Practical examples demonstrating conditional logic in action
